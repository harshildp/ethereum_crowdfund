# EtherFund - An Ethereum based Crowdfunding Site
A kickstarter esque crowdfunding website which utilizes ethereum and blockchain to correct the pervasive scamming problem with kickstarter. A user may create a campaign by allocating a minimum contribution. Other users may contribute the minimum amount or more in order to become approvers of the campaign. The original creator of the campaign is marked as the campaign manager. The manager is allowed to create spend requests in order to allocate the campaign balance to some task. The approvers of the campaign must vote on each request in order to approve the expenditure. A majority vote is required after which the manager may finalize a request and the appropriate sum is automatically sent out. 

The website itself is a mutlipage application which allows multiple campaigns to be created and managed on the Rinkeby ethereum test network. Each campaign has its own show, requests and new request page. There is also a page to create a new campaign and the index page showcases all the current campaigns.
